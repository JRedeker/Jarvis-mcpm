# Jarvis Brand & SEO Memo

## 1. The "Hook" (Value Proposition)
**Concept:** Bridging High-Level Intelligence with Low-Level Control.
**One-Liner:** "The local infrastructure layer for AI agents. Jarvis gives your LLM hands—terminal access, file control, and DevOps tooling—without sacrificing security."

## 2. The "Anti-Cringe" Rules
*   **Banned Phrases:** "Unleash the power," "Revolutionize your workflow," "Supercharge," "Blazing fast," "Magic," "Game-changer."
*   **Engineering Replacements:**
    *   Instead of "Supercharge your coding," use **"Automate repetitive scaffolding."**
    *   Instead of "Blazing fast," use **"Written in Go for instant startup."**
    *   Instead of "Unlock the power of AI," use **"Connect any LLM to your local filesystem via MCP."**
*   **Tone:** Professional, precise, "Official SDK" vibes (inspired by `modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk`). We are building *infrastructure*, not a toy.

## 3. SEO Strategy & Keywords
**Primary Keywords:**
*   "Local MCP Server"
*   "Agentic DevOps"
*   "AI Code Scaffolding"
*   "Self-hosted AI Tools"

**Secondary Keywords:**
*   "DevOps Automation"
*   "Pre-commit for AI"
*   "Secure AI Infrastructure"
*   "Model Context Protocol Go"

## 4. Proposed README Structure (Draft)
1.  **Header:** Minimalist ASCII Art Logo + Badges (Go Report, License, MCP Compatible).
2.  **Hero Section:**
    *   **One-Liner:** "The local DevOps runtime for AI agents."
    *   **Problem:** "Agents are great at logic, bad at logistics. They break builds, ignore linters, and hallucinate file paths."
    *   **Solution:** "Jarvis enforces the engineering loop. It scaffolds projects, runs pre-commits, and manages infrastructure so your agent stays on the rails."
3.  **Features (The "Roles"):**
    *   **Architect:** Scaffolding (Git, Pre-commit, Workflows).
    *   **Mechanic:** Infrastructure Management (Docker, Postgres, Qdrant).
    *   **Critic:** Diff Review & Self-Correction.
4.  **Quick Start:**
    *   `go build -o jarvis .`
    *   Add to `claude_desktop_config.json`.
5.  **Advanced Usage:** "Managing Infrastructure via Scripts."
6.  **Architecture:** "3-Layer Profile Stacking" (Link to docs).
