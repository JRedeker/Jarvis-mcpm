# 🤖 Jarvis: The MCP Automation Gateway

Jarvis is your autonomous "hands" for managing the Model Context Protocol (MCP) ecosystem.

**Core Concept:** Jarvis is the pilot; MCPM (Package Manager) is the engine. Jarvis does not store state itself—it queries and controls the underlying MCPM system to install, configure, and run tools for you.

## 🛠️ Command Reference for Agents

Use these tools to manage the user's environment.

### 🚀 Initialization
*   **`bootstrap_system()`**
    *   *When to use:* If the user says "Start the system", "Initialize", or if other commands fail with "command not found".
    *   *What it does:* Installs the package manager (MCPM), links the CLI, and starts the Docker infrastructure (Postgres/Qdrant).

### 📦 Server Management
*   **`install_server(name="server_name")`**
    *   *When to use:* When the user needs a new tool (e.g., "I need to search the web" -> `install_server("brave")`).
    *   *Important:* After installing, **read the output**. It provides the JSON config snippet the user needs to add to their client configuration.
*   **`uninstall_server(name="server_name")`**
    *   *When to use:* To remove a tool or clean up.
*   **`list_servers()`**
    *   *When to use:* To see what is currently installed and available.
*   **`search_servers(query="search term")`**
    *   *When to use:* To discover new tools in the registry (e.g., "Find me a tool for GitHub").

### ⚙️ Configuration
*   **`check_status()`**
    *   *When to use:* To debug issues. Checks Node.js, Docker, and Config health.
*   **`server_info(name="server_name")`**
    *   *When to use:* To get details about a specific tool (repo URL, description).

### 🌐 Sharing
*   **`share_server(name="server_name")`**
    *   *When to use:* To expose a local tool to the public internet via a secure tunnel. Returns a public URL.
*   **`stop_sharing_server(name="server_name")`**
    *   *When to use:* To close the tunnel.

## 🧠 Agent Strategy

1.  **Always Check Status First:** If unsure, run `check_status()` or `list_servers()`.
2.  **Bootstrap if Needed:** If `list_servers()` fails or returns nothing on a fresh install, suggest running `bootstrap_system()`.
3.  **Docker Preference:** Jarvis automatically prefers Docker for installation if available. You don't need to specify "docker" manually; just `install_server("name")`.
4.  **Config Snippets:** When you install a server, the output contains the exact JSON config. **Show this to the user** so they can update their `claude_desktop_config.json`.
