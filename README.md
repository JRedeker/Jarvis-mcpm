## 🤔 Why Jarvis?

Most MCP gateways are simple proxies that forward tool calls to underlying servers. **Jarvis is fundamentally different—it's an intelligent presentation layer designed specifically for AI agents.**

### The Problem with Standard MCP Gateways

**Raw Output Noise:**
- AI agents receive terminal output with ANSI color codes
- Warning messages and debug info pollute responses
- LLMs struggle to parse unstructured CLI output
- Errors are cryptic with no guidance on fixes

**No Intelligence:**
- No validation before execution (errors discovered after)
- No understanding of project context
- No suggestions for next steps
- Agents repeat mistakes because gateways can't teach

**Manual Everything:**
- Infrastructure failures require human intervention
- Tool installation interrupts agent workflows
- No auto-recovery when services crash
- Configuration is error-prone manual work

### The Jarvis Solution

**🎯 AI-Optimized Interface:**
- Clean Markdown output, zero ANSI codes
- Structured responses with status emojis (✅/❌)
- Stripped warnings and debug noise
- LLM-friendly formatting

**🧠 Intelligent Layer:**
- Pre-execution validation catches mistakes
- Context-aware suggestions based on project state
- Next-step guidance after every operation
- Learning loop: agents improve over time

**⚡ Autonomous Operations:**
- Self-healing: `restart_infrastructure()` repairs crashed services
- Dynamic expansion: Install tools on-demand from MCPM registry
- Batch workflows: Complex operations in single commands
- Zero-config profiles: Automatic tool stack selection

**🛡️ Production-Grade:**
- DevOps scaffolding: CI/CD, linting, pre-commit hooks
- Security guardrails: Gitleaks blocks secrets before commit
- Type-safe Go core: No runtime drift
- Battle-tested: Powers real agent workflows

## 🆚 What Makes Jarvis Different

Unlike standard MCP gateways (MCPJungle, MetaMCP, etc.) that focus on proxying and aggregation, Jarvis adds an **intelligent presentation layer**:

| Differentiator | What It Means |
|:---------------|:--------------|
| **Clean Output** | Strips ANSI codes, formats as Markdown with status emojis (✅/❌) |
| **DevOps Scaffolding** | `apply_devops_stack()` creates CI/CD, pre-commit hooks, Gitleaks—no other gateway does this |
| **Self-Healing** | `restart_infrastructure()` auto-repairs crashed Docker services |
| **Smart Validation** | Pre-execution input checks with contextual fix suggestions |

**Bottom Line:** Other gateways forward calls. Jarvis transforms raw CLI into agent-optimized responses.

---

## 📦 Powered by MCPM

Jarvis uses [**MCPM**](https://github.com/pathintegral-institute/mcpm.sh) (MCP Manager) as its package management backend. MCPM provides:

- **200+ Server Registry** — Curated MCP servers with metadata and installation recipes
- **Profile System** — Composable tool sets activated per-project or per-client
- **Cross-Platform** — Works on Linux, macOS, Windows

Jarvis wraps MCPM's CLI with intelligent formatting, validation, and DevOps features. You get the full MCPM registry plus agent-optimized tooling.

## ⚡ The DevOps Stack for AI Engineering

Jarvis transforms your AI Agent from a passive chatbot into a **Full-Stack DevOps Engineer**. It enforces a production-grade stack on every project it touches, ensuring that AI-generated code is secure, tested, and standardized before you ever see a commit.

| Capability | Technology | What It Does |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **🔌 Tool Management** | [**MCPM**](https://github.com/pathintegral-institute/mcpm.sh) | **Dynamic Expansion:** Installs and hot-loads new tools via [**MCPM**](mcpm_source/README.md) on demand. |
| **🛡️ Guardrails** | **Git Hooks & Secret Detection** | **Automatic Safety:** Blocks secrets and bad formatting *before* the commit happens (e.g., `pre-commit`, `gitleaks`). |
| **🧐 Review** | **AI Code Reviewer** | **Self-Correction:** Auto-reviews PRs with commands like `/review` & `/improve` (e.g., `CodiumAI PR-Agent`). |
| **🧠 Memory** | **Vector Database** | **Context Retention:** Remembers codebase details and decisions across sessions (e.g., `Qdrant`, `Mem0`). |
| **🏗️ Tool Integration** | **Linters, Formatters & Type Checkers** | **DevOps Stacks:** Precisely chosen tools for your project (e.g., `Ruff`, `Prettier`, `GoFmt`). |
| **🔎 Research** | **Structured Docs & Web** | **Live Context:** Fetches current library documentation and code examples to prevent hallucinations (e.g., `Context7`, `Firecrawl`). |

## 🎯 Using Jarvis: The Primary Interface

**Jarvis tools are designed specifically for AI agents** and provide significant advantages over direct CLI usage:

### ✅ Why Jarvis Tools Over Direct CLI?

| Jarvis Advantages | Direct CLI Limitations |
|:---|:---|
| **Clean, Structured Output** - No ANSI codes, stripped warnings, formatted responses | Raw terminal output with color codes and noise |
| **Smart Error Handling** - Actionable error messages with suggestions | Generic error messages requiring interpretation |
| **Validation & Safety** - Prevents common mistakes before execution | No validation, errors discovered after execution |
| **Context Awareness** - Understands your project and suggests appropriate actions | No awareness of project state or configuration |
| **Batch Operations** - Complex workflows in single commands | Multiple manual CLI commands required |
| **Next Step Guidance** - Tells you what to do after success | Figure out next steps yourself |

### 🔧 Quick Reference

When working with AI agents, **always prefer Jarvis tools**:

| Task | ✅ Use Jarvis Tool | ❌ Not Direct CLI |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Install MCP server | `install_server("brave-search")` | ~~`mcpm install brave-search`~~ |
| Check system health | `check_status()` | ~~`mcpm doctor`~~ |
| Manage profiles | `manage_profile("edit", "p-pokeedge", add_servers="...")` | ~~`mcpm profile edit`~~ |
| Search for tools | `search_servers("documentation")` | ~~`mcpm search documentation`~~ |
| Configure clients | `manage_client("edit", "codex", add_server="...")` | ~~`mcpm client edit`~~ |
| Bootstrap system | `bootstrap_system()` | ~~Multiple manual steps~~ |

**Note:** Direct MCPM CLI is still available for debugging Jarvis itself or manual operations outside AI agent workflows.

## 🚀 Real-World Workflows

Jarvis is built on a strict Go backbone that eliminates drift and guarantees execution. Click any scenario to see how it works:

<details>
<summary><b>1. 🏗️ Intelligent Scaffolding & Research</b></summary>

**Problem:** *You have a messy legacy Python repo with no standards, or a blank folder for a new Go microservice.*

> **Example Conversation:**
>
> **You:** *"This old script needs to be production-ready."*
> <br>
> **Agent:** *"I've analyzed the directory. It's a Python project lacking linting. I'm applying the standard DevOps stack now."*
> <br>
> **Agent:** *"Done! I've set up pre-commit hooks with Ruff and Gitleaks, created a GitHub Actions workflow, and initialized git. Try making your first commit."*

**The Jarvis Fix:** Instead of blindly guessing which linters to install, the Agent uses Jarvis to **analyze the codebase state first**.
1.  **Analyze:** The Agent calls `analyze_project()` to read file signatures (e.g., `pyproject.toml`, `go.mod`).
2.  **Decide:** It detects that `pre-commit` config is missing or incomplete.
3.  **Execute:** It calls `apply_devops_stack(project_type="python", force=true)`. Jarvis programmatically writes a hardened `.pre-commit-config.yaml` and GitHub Actions workflow, ensuring the project adheres to the "Prime Stack" standard immediately.

**What Jarvis Did:**
- Created `.pre-commit-config.yaml` with Ruff (linting + formatting) and Gitleaks (secret detection)
- Generated `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for automated testing
- Created Makefile with common targets
- Initialized git repository
- Installed pre-commit hooks
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>2. 🔧 Self-Healing Infrastructure</b></summary>

**Problem:** *Your RAG application is failing because the local Vector DB crashed.*

> **Example Conversation:**
>
> **You:** *"Why is my search failing?"*
> <br>
> **Agent:** *"Checking system status... Qdrant is down. Restarting infrastructure..."*
> <br>
> **Agent:** *"Done. Services are healthy. Retrying search... Here are your results."*

**The Jarvis Fix:** Normally, this requires a context switch to the terminal. Jarvis allows the Agent to **diagnose and repair** the underlying infrastructure itself.
1.  **Diagnose:** The Agent calls `check_status()` and parses the output to see the Qdrant container is unhealthy.
2.  **Repair:** It calls `restart_infrastructure()`.
3.  **Verify:** Jarvis executes the Docker restart sequence via its internal Go logic, waits for health checks to pass, and confirms the service is back online—all without human intervention.

**What Jarvis Did:**
- Detected Qdrant container failure via health checks
- Gracefully stopped both PostgreSQL and Qdrant containers
- Restarted containers with proper sequencing
- Waited for health checks to pass (PostgreSQL port 5432, Qdrant port 6333)
- Confirmed all services operational before continuing
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>3. 🔌 Autonomous Tool Expansion</b></summary>

**Problem:** *You ask the Agent to "Analyze this PDF contract," but it has no PDF tools loaded.*

> **Example Conversation:**
>
> **You:** *"Summarize this PDF contract."*
> <br>
> **Agent:** *"I don't have a PDF reader installed. Installing `pdf-parse` via MCPM..."*
> <br>
> **Agent:** *"Tool loaded. Reading contract.pdf... This is a service agreement with payment terms of Net 30 days, auto-renewal clause on page 5..."*

**The Jarvis Fix:** Jarvis connects your Agent to the massive MCPM registry, enabling **on-demand capability expansion**.
1.  **Search:** The Agent calls `search_servers("pdf")` and identifies a relevant tool.
2.  **Install:** It calls `install_server("pdf-parse")`.
3.  **Use:** Jarvis hot-loads the new tool into the active session. The Agent effectively "upgrades itself" in real-time to solve your specific problem.

**What Jarvis Did:**
- Searched MCPM registry for PDF-related tools (200+ available servers)
- Found `pdf-parse` with metadata and installation instructions
- Installed npm package `@modelcontextprotocol/server-pdf`
- Hot-loaded the tool without restarting the agent
- Made `pdf_extract` tool immediately available
- Tool persists for future sessions
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>4. 🛡️ Security & Safety Loops</b></summary>

**Problem:** *The Agent writes code that accidentally hardcodes an API key.*

> **Example Conversation:**
>
> **Agent:** *"I've updated the API client. Committing changes..."*
> <br>
> **Agent:** *"❌ COMMIT BLOCKED: Secret detected in `client.py` line 42."*
> <br>
> **Agent:** *"I've moved the API key to `.env` and updated the code to use `os.getenv('API_KEY')`. Committing again..."*
> <br>
> **Agent:** *"✅ Commit successful. No secrets detected."*

**The Jarvis Fix:** Jarvis acts as an immutable **security gatekeeper**.
1.  **Prevention:** When the Agent attempts to commit code, Jarvis intercepts the action and runs local hooks like `gitleaks`.
2.  **Intervention:** If a secret is detected, the commit is **programmatically blocked**.
3.  **Correction:** The error output is returned to the Agent, forcing it to remove the hardcoded key and use `.env` variables before retrying. This ensures no secrets ever enter your commit history.

**What Jarvis Did:**
- Pre-commit hook ran `gitleaks` scan on staged files
- Detected hardcoded secret pattern: `api_key = "sk-..."`
- Blocked commit with clear error message and line number
- Agent self-corrected by moving secret to `.env`
- Second commit passed all security checks
- Zero secrets entered git history
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>5. 🔄 Context Switching Between Projects</b></summary>

**Problem:** *You're switching from a backend Go service to a frontend React app. Each needs different tools.*

> **Example Conversation:**
>
> **You:** *"I'm switching to work on the dashboard now."*
> <br>
> **Agent:** *"Detected React project in ~/dashboard. Loading project-frontend profile..."*
> <br>
> **Agent:** *"Ready! I've activated Prettier for formatting, ESLint for linting, and research tools. What would you like to build?"*

**The Jarvis Fix:** Jarvis's profile system auto-detects context and loads the right tool stack.
1.  **Navigate:** You move from `~/api-service` (Go) to `~/dashboard` (React).
2.  **Suggest:** The Agent calls `suggest_profile(client_name="cursor")` in the new directory.
3.  **Analyze:** Jarvis detects `package.json` with React dependencies.
4.  **Load:** Returns profile stack: `["project-frontend", "client-cursor", "memory"]`.
5.  **Activate:** Agent knows to use frontend tools (Prettier, ESLint) instead of Go tools (GoFmt, golangci-lint).

**What Jarvis Did:**
- Analyzed working directory: `/home/user/dashboard`
- Detected `package.json` with React dependencies
- Recommended 3-Layer Profile Stack:
  - Layer 1: `project-frontend` (Prettier, ESLint, npm scripts)
  - Layer 2: `client-cursor` (Cursor IDE optimizations)
  - Layer 3: `memory` (persistent context across sessions)
- Agent seamlessly switches tooling based on project context
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>6. 🔍 Research-Driven Development (Specialized Docs Access)</b></summary>

**Problem:** *You ask the Agent to implement a feature using a library, but it was trained on outdated syntax that's now deprecated.*

> **Example Conversation:**
>
> **You:** *"Add server actions for the checkout flow."*
> <br>
> **Agent:** *"The server action syntax has changed since my training. Installing Context7 to fetch current docs..."*
> <br>
> **Agent:** *"Context7 returned 47 code snippets for server actions. Implementing with current patterns..."*
> <br>
> **Agent:** *"Done. I've used the latest API pattern with proper error boundaries. Ready for review."*

**The Jarvis Fix:** Context7 provides **structured library documentation with code examples** - not just web search results. This is fundamentally different from built-in web fetch:

| Capability | Built-in Web Fetch | 🌟 Context7 via Jarvis |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Data Source** | Generic web pages | npm, PyPI, GitHub official docs |
| **Format** | Raw HTML/text | Structured JSON with code snippets |
| **Versioning** | Whatever Google returns | Specific version docs on demand |
| **Code Examples** | May be outdated | Live, tested snippets |

1.  **Install Specialized Tool:** Agent calls `install_server("context7")` to get structured docs access.
2.  **Resolve Library:** Uses `resolve_library_id("library-name")` → Returns versioned library ID.
3.  **Fetch Docs:** Calls `get_library_docs("/org/library", topic="feature", mode="code")`.
4.  **Returns:** Structured code snippets with imports, type signatures, and working examples.
5.  **Implement:** Agent uses **current syntax**, not outdated training data.

**What Jarvis Did:**
- Installed `context7` MCP server from MCPM registry (not available in typical clients)
- Retrieved **structured** documentation for the latest library version (not web scraping)
- Returned code snippets with proper types and imports
- Agent used current syntax patterns, avoiding deprecated APIs
- **Key difference:** Structured library docs, not generic web search
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>7. 📦 Dynamic Capability Expansion</b></summary>

**Problem:** *Mid-conversation, you ask "Can you analyze this PDF contract?" but the Agent has no PDF tools.*

> **Example Conversation:**
>
> **You:** *"Extract the payment terms from this contract.pdf."*
> <br>
> **Agent:** *"I don't have PDF tools installed. Searching MCPM registry for 'pdf'..."*
> <br>
> **Agent:** *"Found pdf-parse. Installing from npm..."*
> <br>
> **Agent:** *"Tool loaded. Extracting text from contract.pdf..."*
> <br>
> **Agent:** *"Payment terms found on page 3: Net 30 days, 2% discount if paid within 10 days. Late fees: 1.5% per month after 30 days."*

**The Jarvis Fix:** The Agent expands its own capabilities in real-time.
1.  **Detect Gap:** Agent recognizes it lacks PDF processing capability.
2.  **Search:** Calls `search_servers("pdf")` and finds `pdf-parse`.
3.  **Install:** Calls `install_server("pdf-parse")`.
4.  **Hot-Load:** MCPM installs the tool without restarting the Agent.
5.  **Use:** Agent immediately uses the new `pdf_extract` tool to process your file.
6.  **Remember:** The tool remains available for future sessions.

**What Jarvis Did:**
- Detected missing PDF processing capability
- Searched MCPM registry: found 3 PDF-related tools
- Selected `pdf-parse` as most appropriate for text extraction
- Installed npm package without session restart
- Hot-loaded `pdf_extract` tool into active session
- Processed PDF and extracted structured text
- Tool persists in MCPM registry for future use
- Agent "upgraded itself" mid-conversation

*   **Option B (Manual):** Copy the JSON into your client's config file (e.g., `claude_desktop_config.json`, `cursor_mcp.json`, or VS Code settings).

### 3. Bootstrap
Open your Agent and say:
> **"Bootstrap the system."**

The Agent will call `jarvis.bootstrap_system()`, which will:
1.  Install the **MCPM** package manager.
2.  Spin up **Postgres** and **Qdrant** (Docker).
3.  Install the **Guardian Stack** (`context7`, `brave-search`, `github`).

```
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>✅ Input Validation Examples</b></summary>

```javascript
// Invalid server name
install_server("")
// ❌ Error: Server name cannot be empty
// 💡 Suggestion: Use search_servers() to find available tools

// Server doesn't exist
install_server("nonexistent-tool")
// ❌ Error: Server "nonexistent-tool" not found in registry
// 💡 Suggestion: Try search_servers("nonexistent-tool") for similar tools
```
</details>

**Why This Matters for AI Agents:**
- ⚡ Faster learning: Clean output = faster pattern recognition
- 🛡️ Fewer mistakes: Validation prevents repeated errors

## ⚙️ Advanced Features

<details>
<summary><b>📚 3-Layer Profile Stack</b></summary>

Jarvis uses a composable configuration architecture that eliminates duplication:

**Layer 1 (Environment):** Workspace-specific tools
- `project-pokeedge`: Web research (Brave, Firecrawl, Context7)
- `project-frontend`: React tools (Prettier, ESLint)
- `project-backend`: Go tools (gofmt, golangci-lint)

**Layer 2 (Client Adapter):** AI client-specific
- `client-cursor`: Cursor IDE enhancements
- `client-claude`: Claude-specific optimizations

**Layer 3 (Global):** Cross-cutting capabilities
- `memory`: Vector search, persistent memory
- `testing-all-tools`: Comprehensive tool access

**Benefits:**
- ✅ **No Duplication:** Each server defined once, included in multiple profiles
- ✅ **Easy Switching:** Change environment, keep client/global layers
- ✅ **Composability:** Mix and match layers as needed

See [Configuration Strategy](docs/CONFIGURATION_STRATEGY.md) for full details.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🌐 Server Sharing & Remote Access</b></summary>

Expose local MCP servers to remote agents via secure tunnels:

```javascript
// Share a server
share_server("context7", port="8080", no_auth=false)

// Returns:
✅ context7 shared successfully
🌐 Tunnel URL: https://abc123.jarvis-tunnel.io
🔐 Auth: enabled
```

**Use Cases:**
- Remote team collaboration
- Multi-agent workflows
- Development/staging/production separation
</details>

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

<details>
<summary><b>What makes Jarvis different from other MCP servers?</b></summary>

Unlike gateways that just forward calls, Jarvis is a **presentation layer** with DevOps scaffolding. See [What Makes Jarvis Different](#-what-makes-jarvis-different) for the full comparison.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Do I need Docker?</b></summary>

**Yes**, for the infrastructure layer (PostgreSQL, Qdrant). These power memory capabilities and vector search.

**Installation:**
```bash
# Linux
sudo apt install docker.io docker-compose-plugin

# macOS
brew install --cask docker

# Then start infrastructure
./scripts/manage-mcp.sh start
```

Or let the agent run `bootstrap_system()` to handle it automatically.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Can I use Jarvis with my existing MCP servers?</b></summary>

**Absolutely!** Jarvis uses the MCPM registry with 200+ servers. Install any tool:

```javascript
search_servers("your-tool-category")  // Find tools
install_server("tool-name")           // Install
```

You can also register custom servers with `create_server()`.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Don't most clients already have web search and file tools?</b></summary>

Yes, but MCPM's registry offers **specialized** tools that go far beyond built-in capabilities:

| Built-in | MCPM Specialized Tool |
|:---|:---|
| Generic web search | `context7`: Structured library docs with code snippets from npm/PyPI |
| Basic URL fetch | `firecrawl`: Intelligent scraping with Markdown/table extraction |
| Read files | `pdf-parse`: Extract text, tables, metadata from PDFs |
| Git commands | `gitleaks`: Pre-commit hook that **blocks** secrets before commit |
| Fixed toolset | **200+ servers** installable mid-conversation without restart |

The unique value is **dynamic capability expansion**—your agent can install specialized tools on-demand.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Which AI models/clients does Jarvis support?</b></summary>

**Any model or client that supports MCP:**

**Models:** Claude, GPT, Gemini, DeepSeek, Llama, Mistral, and more

**Clients:** Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, VS Code, Zed, Kilo Code

If your tool speaks MCP, it works with Jarvis. See [Universal Compatibility](#-universal-compatibility).
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How does Jarvis handle secrets and security?</b></summary>

**Pre-Commit Protection:**
- `apply_devops_stack()` installs `gitleaks` hook
- Scans commits for API keys, tokens, passwords
- **Blocks commit** if secrets detected
- Forces agent to use environment variables

**Additional Security:**
- Validates all inputs (prevents command injection)
- Sandboxed Docker containers
- No automatic push to remote
- Audit logs for all operations
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>What if I encounter errors?</b></summary>

**Debugging Steps:**

1. **Check System Health:**
   ```javascript
   check_status()
   ```

2. **Common Fixes:**
   - **Docker not running:** `./scripts/manage-mcp.sh start`
   - **MCPM not found:** `bootstrap_system()`
   - **Port conflicts:** Run `docker compose ps`

3. **Self-Healing:**
   ```javascript
   restart_infrastructure()  // Repairs crashed services
   ```

See [Troubleshooting](#-troubleshooting) for detailed error resolution.
