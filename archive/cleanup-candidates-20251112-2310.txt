Cleanup candidates report
Generated: 2025-11-12 23:10:00 (local)

Summary
-------
Scanned directories: logs/, scripts/, tests-and-notes/, data/, docs/, archive/
Found many log files in logs/ (rotated timestamps from 2025-11-10 to 2025-11-12).
Found three small scripts in scripts/ used for telemetry/OTLP stack.
Found many files under tests-and-notes/ (testing scripts, validation reports, and pyc caches).
Found data DB files and memory-bank documentation.

Top candidates (by category)
---------------------------
1) logs/ (high priority to archive/rotate)
- Many cipher-aggregator-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.log files (sizes 8K-641K, most ~10-60K)
- mcp-manager-YYYYMMDD-*.log (many small rotated logs)
- cipher-aggregator.log, cipher.log (current aggregate logs)
- PID files: cipher-aggregator.pid, cipher.pid
- routing-metadata.log (0 bytes) and telemetry-bootstrap.log (152 bytes)

Recommendation: Archive rotated logs older than a retention window (e.g. keep last 7 days or last N files). Optionally truncate or rotate current live logs but do NOT delete active log files (e.g., cipher-aggregator.log) while services are running.

2) scripts/
- scripts/deploy-otlp-stack.sh (7444 bytes)
- scripts/run-telemetry-local.sh (7772 bytes)
- scripts/test-otlp-logs.py (9073 bytes)

Recommendation: These are legitimate utility scripts; keep in repo. No action unless you want to remove tests or move to docs.

3) tests-and-notes/
- Many test scripts and markdown summaries (sizes 1K-39K). Several __pycache__ .pyc files are present.

Recommendation: Keep source test files, but remove compiled __pycache__ files (safe to delete). Consider archiving long validation reports and older phase summaries into archive/ if they're one-time references.

4) data/ and docs/
- data/cipher-sessions.db and WAL/shm files (active DB files). DO NOT delete unless you want to lose session state.
- data/routing_decisions.db (49KB)
- docs/ yaml and md files (config & docs) - keep.

Recommendation: Do NOT touch DB files. Keep docs. Consider archiving large historical docs if obsolete.

Proposed safe actions (pick one)
--------------------------------
A) Scan-only (no destructive actions) — I will list candidates (done) and wait for approval. (default)
B) Archive-only — I will create a timestamped tar.gz under archive/ with selected files (rotated logs, __pycache__ files, and phase reports). I will NOT delete originals.
C) Archive-and-delete — I will archive selected files then remove originals. This is destructive; confirm file selection criteria and exclusions.

Default selection I recommend for archiving (safe):
- All logs matching logs/cipher-aggregator-YYYYMMDD-*.log
- All logs matching logs/mcp-manager-YYYYMMDD-*.log
- All __pycache__ directories under tests-and-notes/
- Any files in tests-and-notes/ with names containing 'phase1'..'phase8' or 'phase*_summary' older than 7 days (you can change threshold)

Next steps
----------
Please confirm which action to take and any exclusions or age thresholds. Example replies:
- "Scan only" (do nothing else) — I'm done.
- "Archive-only: archive logs older than 1 day, exclude tests-and-notes" — I will archive matching files to /home/jrede/dev/MCP/archive/cleanup-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.tar.gz and list results.
- "Archive-and-delete: archive logs older than 7 days and delete originals; exclude data/ and docs/" — I will perform archiving and deletion.

Task progress checklist (current)
- [x] Analyze repository to find cleanup candidates (completed)
- [ ] Present categorized list of candidate files with size and age for review
- [ ] Get your approval for files to archive/delete
- [ ] Create timestamped archive(s) of approved files under archive/
- [ ] Delete original approved files
- [ ] (Optional) Add cleanup rules to .gitignore and document changes in README
- [ ] Verify system still runs / run basic smoke checks (if desired)
