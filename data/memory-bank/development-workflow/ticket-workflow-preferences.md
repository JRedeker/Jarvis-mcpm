# Ticket Workflow Preferences

## Ticket Creation Process

When creating tickets for new features or tasks:

1. **Draft the ticket** with clear:
   - Objective
   - Problem statement
   - Implementation approach
   - Acceptance criteria

2. **Present to user for review** BEFORE beginning implementation:
   - Show the acceptance criteria
   - Ask user to review and approve
   - Make adjustments based on feedback

3. **Only begin implementation** after user approves the ticket

## Rationale

- Ensures alignment on requirements before work begins
- Prevents building the wrong thing
- User can adjust scope/priorities upfront
- Saves time by avoiding rework

## Example Workflow

```
1. User: "Add feature X"
2. Agent: "I've drafted a ticket for this at tickets/feature-x.md.
   Please review the acceptance criteria before I begin implementation."
3. User reviews and approves
4. Agent: "Starting implementation based on approved ticket..."
```
