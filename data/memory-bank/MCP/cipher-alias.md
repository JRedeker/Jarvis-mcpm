# Tooling Memory — Cipher Alias

Created: 2025-11-13T03:31:28.958Z

Key tooling memory (alias):

- When I say "cipher", I mean `cipher-aggregator`, the single MCP server for this workspace located at `~/dev/MCP/`.
- It is the only MCP server that our clients/agents will see.
- Cipher-aggregator exposes and aggregates a long list of tools (Firecrawl, Memory Bank, Httpie, Schemathesis, Pytest, GitHub, Brave Search, Filesystem, Code Index, Context7, and built-in cipher semantic tools).

Notes:
- Treat the name "cipher" as shorthand for `cipher-aggregator` in all agent instructions and routing rules.
- Filename: cipher-alias.md
