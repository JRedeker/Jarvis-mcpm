Core tenants (operational guidance):

1. Simple is best. Keep it clean.
2. Minimize risk. Go by the book/docs/manual.
3. Complex is better than complicated.
4. Fail fast and communicate quickly.
5. The past is in the past.

Notes:
- These are intended as a concise, referable memory for decision-making and prioritization.
